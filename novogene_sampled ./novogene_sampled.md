The data in this folder are from the Iowa deep loess soil project and are for use in a tutorial on how to process Novogene paired-end sequences.
They are form the short core samples sequenced in and have been sampled to 10% of the original number of sequences.
I also use the processed reults in my video tutorials made mainly for Shawn's students and put on Shawn's Teams site.
